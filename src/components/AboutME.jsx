<p >My journey in web development started when I was doing a basic CSS tutorial and was amazed by how time flew as I found inner peace in coding. That moment sparked my passion, and I decided to pursue a career as a developer. <br /> <br /> With experience in React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js, I focus on building high-quality, responsive web applications that deliver great user experiences.

I believe in clean, efficient code . In near future ,I am really interested to  explore some new technologies for me like Typescript,Mongoose,Redux,Nextjs and many more. Whether it's building a blog or a full-fledged application, I approach every project with dedication and attention to detail.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy making food for my family and Spending time with them</p>
